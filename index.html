            One example of the application of AI to robotics is a robot that can
            move automatically. By using AI technology, robots can learn how to
            move by themselves, without even needing a special program. Robots
            will continue to learn and improve their ability to move, so they
            can perform more complex tasks such as lifting and moving heavy
            objects. Apart from that, AI can also be used in robots that are
            used in environments that are dangerous or difficult for humans to
            reach. Robots like this can be programmed to carry out specific
            missions, such as exploration in disaster areas or maintenance of
            hard-to-reach infrastructure. With AI, robots can carry out these
            tasks more accurately and efficiently, and can speed up the rescue
            or maintenance process. One example of the application of AI in

            One example of the application of AI to robotics is a robot that can
            move automatically. By using AI technology, robots can learn how to
            move by themselves, without even needing a special program. Robots
            will continue to learn and improve their ability to move, so they
            can perform more complex tasks such as lifting and moving heavy
            objects. Apart from that, AI can also be used in robots that are
            used in environments that are dangerous or difficult for humans to
            reach. Robots like this can be programmed to carry out specific
            missions, such as exploration in disaster areas or maintenance of
            hard-to-reach infrastructure. With AI, robots can carry out these
            tasks more accurately and efficiently, and can speed up the rescue
            or maintenance process. One example of the application of AI in
